Building:
    hmake HsColour
or
    ghc --make -cpp -ffi HsColour

Usage:
    HsColour [-tty|-html] [file.hs]

The program can colourise a Haskell source file for either terminal
output (option -tty) or HTML output (option -html).  The default
is for terminal output, which uses standard ANSI screen codes for
the colours.

If no file argument is given, it reads standard input.  Output is
always written to standard output.

You can configure the colours for different lexical entities by
editing a configuration file called .hscolour in the current directory.
(An example is included in the distribution.)  The file format is as
a simple Haskell value of type ColourPrefs, constructed using named
fields, as follows:

  data ColourPrefs = ColourPrefs
    { keyword, keyglyph, layout, comment
    , conid, varid, conop, varop
    , string, char, number
    , selection, variantselection :: [Highlight]
    }

  data Colour = Black | Red | Green | Yellow | Blue | Magenta | Cyan | White

  data Highlight =
      Normal
    | Bold
    | Dim
    | Underscore
    | Blink
    | ReverseVideo
    | Concealed
    | Foreground Colour
    | Background Colour
