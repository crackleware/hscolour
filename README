HsColour: A Haskell source-code colouriser.

Building:
    hmake HsColour
or
    ghc --make HsColour

Usage:
    HsColour [ -tty | -html | -css | -anchorHTML | -anchorCSS ] [file.hs]

The program can colourise a Haskell source file for either terminal
output (option -tty) or HTML output with font tags (option -html), or
HTML output with CSS (option -css).  The default is for terminal output,
which uses standard ANSI screen codes for the colours.

If no file argument is given, it reads standard input.  Output is
always written to standard output.

HsColour can add named anchors (with -anchorHTML or -anchorCSS) to
top-level definitions in the source file (functions, datatypes,
classes).  This enables you to make links to a specific location in the
generated file with the standard "file.html#anchor" notation.

You can configure the colours for different lexical entities by
editing a configuration file called .hscolour in the current directory.
(An example is included in the distribution.)  The file format is as
a simple Haskell value of type ColourPrefs, constructed using named
fields, as follows:

  data ColourPrefs = ColourPrefs
    { keyword, keyglyph, layout, comment
    , conid, varid, conop, varop
    , string, char, number
    , selection, variantselection :: [Highlight]
    }

  data Colour = Black | Red | Green | Yellow | Blue | Magenta | Cyan | White

  data Highlight =
      Normal
    | Bold
    | Dim
    | Underscore
    | Blink
    | ReverseVideo
    | Concealed
    | Foreground Colour
    | Background Colour

For CSS output, it is sufficient to edit the hscolour.css file, also in
the distribution.
