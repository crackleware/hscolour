HsColour: A Haskell source-code colouriser.

Building:
    hmake HsColour
or
    ghc --make HsColour

Usage:
    HsColour [-Ofile]
             [ -tty | -html | -css | -icss | -latex | -mirc ]
             [ -lit | -lit-tex | -anchor  | -partial ]
             [ -nolit          | -noanchor| -nopartial ]
             [file.hs]

The program can colourise a Haskell source file for either terminal
output (option -tty), or HTML 3.2 output with font tags (option -html),
or HTML 4.01 output with CSS (option -css), or HTML 4.01 output with
inline styling (option -icss) or LaTeX output (option -latex), or IRC
chat client (option -mirc).  The default is for terminal output, which
uses standard ANSI screen codes for the colours.

If no file argument is given, it reads standard input.  Output is
written to the file specified by the -O option, or by default, stdout.

HsColour can add named anchors in HTML or CSS or ICSS (option -anchor) to
top-level definitions in the source file (functions, datatypes,
classes).  This enables you to make links to a specific location in the
generated file with the standard "file.html#anchor" notation.

If you want to embed several individually colourised fragments into a
larger document, then use the <tt>-partial</tt> option , to omit the
HTML DOCTYPE header, CSS stylesheet link, or LaTeX prologue.

Alternatively, if you have a literate input source (e.g. .lhs file),
then the -lit option passes the literate parts untouched, and
colourises only the code fragments (indicated by Bird-tracks - a
> symbol in the left-most column), as if each was called individually
with -partial.

You can configure the colours for different lexical entities by
editing a configuration file called .hscolour in the current directory.
(An example is included in the distribution.)  The file format is as
a simple Haskell value of type ColourPrefs, constructed using named
fields, as follows:

  data ColourPrefs = ColourPrefs
    { keyword, keyglyph, layout, comment
    , conid, varid, conop, varop
    , string, char, number, cpp
    , selection, variantselection :: [Highlight]
    }

  data Colour = Black | Red | Green | Yellow | Blue | Magenta | Cyan | White

  data Highlight =
      Normal
    | Bold
    | Dim
    | Underscore
    | Blink
    | ReverseVideo
    | Concealed
    | Foreground Colour
    | Background Colour

For CSS output, it is sufficient to edit the hscolour.css file, also in
the distribution.
